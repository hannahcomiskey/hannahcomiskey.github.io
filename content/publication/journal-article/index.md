abstract: Quantifying the public/private-sector supply of contraceptive methods within countries is vital for effective and sustainable family-planning delivery. However, many low- and middle-income countries quantify contraceptive supply using out-of-date Demographic Health Surveys. As an alternative, we propose using a Bayesian, hierarchical, penalized-spline model, with survey input, to produce annual estimates and projections of contraceptive supply-share outcomes. Our approach shares information across countries, accounts for survey observational errors and produces probabilistic projections informed by past changes in supply shares, as well as correlations between supply-share changes across different contraceptive methods. Results may be used to evaluate family-planning program effectiveness and stability.

abstract: In this paper, we introduce the R package mcmsupply which implements Bayesian hierarchical models for estimating and projecting modern contraceptive market supply shares over time. The package implements four model types. These models vary by the administration level of their outcome estimates (national or subnational estimates) and dataset type utilised in the estimation (multi-country or single-country contraceptive market supply datasets). mcmsupply contains a compilation of national and subnational level contraceptive source datasets, generated by IPUMS and Demographic and Health Survey microdata. We describe the functions that implement the models through practical examples. The annual estimates and projections with uncertainty of the contraceptive market supply, produced by mcmcsupply at a national and subnational level, are the first of their kind. These estimates and projections have diverse applications, including acting as an indicator of family planning market stability over time and being utilised in the calculation of estimates of modern contraceptive use.
