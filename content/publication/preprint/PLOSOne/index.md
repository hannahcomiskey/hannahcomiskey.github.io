abstract: Engaging the private sector in contraceptive method supply is critical for creating 1
equitable, sustainable, and accessible healthcare systems. To achieve this, it is essential 2
to understand where women obtain their modern contraceptives. While national-level 3
estimates provide valuable insights into overall trends in contraceptive supply, they 4
often obscure variation within and across subnational regions. Addressing localized 5
needs has become increasingly important as countries adopt decentralized models for 6
family planning services. Decentralization has also underscored the need for reliable 7
subnational estimates of key family planning indicators. The absence of regularly 8
collected subnational data has hindered effective monitoring and decision-making. To 9
bridge this gap, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent attributes in 10
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data to produce Bayesian probabilistic 11
projections of contraceptive method supply shares (the proportions of modern 12
contraceptive methods supplied by public and private sectors) with limited data. Our 13
modeling framework is built on Bayesian hierarchical models. Using penalized splines to 14
track public and private supply shares over time, we leverage the spatial nature of the 15
data and incorporate a correlation structure between recent supply share observations 16
at national and subnational levels. This framework contributes to the domain of 17
subnational estimation of proportions in data-sparse settings, outperforming comparable 18
and previous approaches. As decentralization continues to reshape family planning 19
services, producing reliable subnational estimates of key indicators is increasingly vital 20
for researchers and policymakers.
