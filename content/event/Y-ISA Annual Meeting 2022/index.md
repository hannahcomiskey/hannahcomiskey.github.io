summary: Assessing the longevity and sustainability of modern contraceptive availability and supply
relies on quantifying the contributions of the public and private sectors to the method supply chain. In recent years, subnational estimation of the contraceptive supply share (public vs private sector) has become increasingly important as decision-making decentralises from the national level, making understanding variation across subnational regions (over time) essential for effective management of the contraceptive market. Large-scale national surveys, such as the Demographic and Health survey (DHS) provide valuable information for quantifying the contraceptive supply market. However, countries carry out a DHS approximately every 3-5 years, resulting in the need to bridge data gaps between survey years and project beyond the time of the most recent surveys. Using DHS microdata for 35 countries and 248 subnational regions, we develop a statistical model to produce a set of related contraceptive supply-share outcomes (proportion of modern contraceptive methods supplied by the public and private sectors) at the subnational level. The model builds on a national-level model which relies on P-splines and a geographical hierarchical structure to estimate the country, method-specific contraceptive supply share over time. This national model utilizes information about correlations between rates of change in method supply across all countries to help to inform supply-share estimates in the absence of data. However, disaggregating the model to the subnational level requires estimation of national-level correlations which poses a problem in data sparse settings when correlations cannot be estimated. To address this problem, we employ K-medoid clustering to cluster countries together using indicators of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need and replace national-level correlations with cluster-level correlations when required. Overall, the modelling approach offers an intuitive way to share information across subnational regions and countries and utilises information about relationships between rates of change in method-supply to inform and produce a set of estimates that reflect the subnational changes in the method-specific contraceptive supply share over time, while accounting for data uncertainties.
