title:  Identifying the drivers of functional group and species-level dynamics over time in an international multi-site grassland experiment.

event: LegacyNet conference 2024
event_url: https://legacynet.scss.tcd.ie/events.php

summary: Using LegacyNet data and Bayesian statistical models, our approach considers how the degree to which realised functional group and speciesâ€™ proportions deviate from sown proportions and change over the grassland ley duration, and how this is affected by sown species diversity and weather (average extreme minima and maxima temperatures and average precipitation for the defined time periods).
